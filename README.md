King Khalid International Airport Flights – Data Analysis 

I worked on my analytical project for flight data at King Khalid International Airport (RUH) . I collected data from a Parquet dataset, cleaned and processed it using Python, and then created visual insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn that provide a clear picture of airport operations and flight patterns.

🛠 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📌 Objective of the Analysis:

The project aims to provide insights into flight operations at King Khalid International Airport by:

* Analyzing the total number of flights and distribution by airline.
* Identifying the most frequently used aircraft models.
* Highlighting peak hours and busiest days for flights.
* Studying flight statuses (Departed, Canceled, Expected, etc.) by airline and hour.
* Examining airport activity by origin and destination airports.

📊 Some Results:

* Total flights in Q1: 153,308 flights.
* Airline with the highest number of flights: Saudi Arabian    60886
* Most frequently used aircraft: Airbus A320   59394
*  the top 5 days with the highest number of flights :
149    2025-08-11          805
156     2025-08-18          803
163     2025-08-25          799
128     2025-07-21          799
142     2025-08-04          798
* airports have the highest number of departing flights : Riyadh    153308
* Flight status: majority of flights departed as scheduled, with a small percentage canceled or delayed.

💡 Key learnings and practical experience through this project:

* Importing and exploring large datasets using Python and Pandas.
* Cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data for analysis.
* Creating statistical summaries and visualizations to extract actionable insights.
* Understanding airline operations, airport traffic, and peak activity periods.
